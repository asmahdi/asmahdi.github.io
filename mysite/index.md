    <p> 
    I am pursuing a master’s degree in geography, with a research focus on spatial data computation and analysis. I work with MATLAB, ArcGIS, Python, JavaScript and other programming languages as needed in his workflow. I also have experience in visualization and computer graphics.
    </p>
    <p> 
    My current research involves developing geospatial analysis methods for road network elevation and a dashboard for real-time flood inundation mapping. I'm also passionate about contributing to the development of open-source geospatial tools.
